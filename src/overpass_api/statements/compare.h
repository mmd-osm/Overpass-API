/* === The statement <em>compare</em> ===

''since v0.7.55''

The statement <em>compare</em> computes the diff of the data of two timestamps.
That diff can consist of any elements as well as only those with specific properties.

It can only be used in diff mode.
In other modes its behaviour is undefined,
and in future versions it might be a syntax error to have it elsewhere.

In the first run of a diff query it returns an empty set.
In the second run of a diff query it returns the difference of the elements.
If the statement gets an evaluator as argument
then only those elements that have different values on both timestamps are returned.
If the element does not exist on one of the timstamps
then its value is regarded as the empty string.
Currently, the only purpose of such a difference is to feed it into an output statement.

The base syntax is

  compare;

In addition, an input and/or output set can be specified:

  .<Set> compare->.<Set>;

With the evaluator, the syntax becomes

  compare(delta:<Evaluator>);

resp.

  .<Set> compare->.<Set>(delta:<Evaluator>);
